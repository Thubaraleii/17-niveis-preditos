# Fossil Occurrence Prediction - LSL

This project includes Python and Java code to predict the presence (I) or absence (F) of key fossil types 
in the Lontras Shale Lagerst√§tte (LSL), based on stratigraphic and geochemical data.

## Files

- `fossil_prediction.py`: Main Python script using scikit-learn and Random Forest classifier.
- `FossilPrediction.java`: Java version using Weka's RandomForest.
- `dados_17_niveis.xlsx` or `dados_17_niveis.arff`: Input data containing fossil, stratigraphic and geochemical indicators.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x with pandas, scikit-learn
- Java 11+ with Weka library installed

## Instructions

1. Place your dataset file (`dados_17_niveis.xlsx` or `.arff`) in the working directory.
2. Run the Python script to train and evaluate models for each fossil category.
3. Alternatively, compile and run the Java version using:
   ```
   javac -cp .:weka.jar FossilPrediction.java
   java -cp .:weka.jar FossilPrediction
   ```

## Authors

Generated for academic purposes by AI with reference to the LSL fossil dataset.
